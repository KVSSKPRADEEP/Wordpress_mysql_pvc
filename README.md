# Wordpress_mysql_pvc
My own Blog of deploying the website on wordpress by kubernetes



Work done desc:
=>Created the Pod using the MySql and Wordpress

=>Later used the PersistantVolumeClaim from the PV in my local Hard-disk

=>And also created the Secret-box to hide the details from the Clients and the devolopers need not worry of the credentials to leak

but as a #fact they are just encoded not encrypted so they are not directly visible for claiming. so little secure.

=> Final the Blog is done with basic idea of what you need must be known and the blog is done.

PRE-Requisites are:
1. minikube setup in yur laptop
2. Kubernetes windows version i.e kubectl need to be setup 
3. little knowledge on the kubectl commands will be of gret help
4. Last but not least don't lose hope will trying


Thank you
